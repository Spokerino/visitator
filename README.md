# visitator

This is my project made on Spring MVC with MySQL database and, of course, it is about students and teachers :)

Current functionality is: browsing/creation/modification/deletion of
- colleges, faculties
- groupssubjects, lessons
- students, teachers

  - changes can be made only by authorised users with proper rights (Srping security)
  - change students presence/absence and change/give them marks in lessons
  - search for particular students
  - search for lessons at particular date
